This past weekend, I pushed my limits and completed my very first triathlon. The experience was one of the most challenging and rewarding of my life.

## The Swim

The race started early in the morning at Perak Marina Island Bay in Lumut. The water was calm, but the energy from the hundreds of participants was electric.

## The Run and the Finish Line

Finally, the 5km run to the finish. My legs were heavy, but the cheering crowd provided a much-needed boost. Crossing that finish line was a feeling I'll never forget!
